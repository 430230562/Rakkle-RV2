  <!-- EN: Rakkles are reptilian humanoids originally found on a remote planet in the Rim. After their discovery, human colonies rounded them up and genetically altered them to have near-human intelligence, but also decreased aggression and appearances better suited to human tastes. They were also modified to give birth to females more often than males, creating a biological need for species interbreeding.\n\nThe newly created Rakkle species were managed by a company known as The Cradle beyond the reaches of the galaxy, while wild Rakkle were hunted and killed to protect the company's interest. Future generations within the facilities were conditioned and raised as slaves and livestock.\n\n After a series of escapes and revolts on planet after planet, a coalition of freed Rakkle began colonies of their own, resisting capture and invasion to create a new world where Rakkle can live outside the yoke of slavery. Despite The Cradle's best efforts, these settlements continue to grow in size and number. -->
  <Xenotype_RakkleBase.description>拉克种属于爬行类人型生物，最初发现于“边缘”中一颗偏远的星球上。在它们被发现后，人类殖民地将它们聚集起来，并对其进行了基因改造，使它们具备近乎人类的智力，同时降低了其攻击性，且外貌变得更符合人类的审美。它们还被改造为生育雌性的概率高于雄性，从而产生了跨物种繁衍的生物学需求。\n\n新诞生的拉克物种由一家名为“响尾蛇”的、位于银河系外的公司管控，而野生的拉克则遭到捕杀，以保护该公司的利益。在其设施内的后代们被驯化并被当作奴隶和牲畜来养育。\n\n在经历了在各个星球上的一系列逃亡和起义之后，一群获得自由的拉克联合起来，开始建立属于自己的殖民地，抵御抓捕和入侵，试图打造一个拉克能够摆脱奴隶制枷锁生活的新世界。尽管“响尾蛇”公司竭尽全力阻止，但这些定居点的规模和数量仍在持续增长。</Xenotype_RakkleBase.description>
